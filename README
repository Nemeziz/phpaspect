DESCRIPTION:

    What is phpAspect?

    phpAspect is a PHP language extension to implement
    Aspect-Oriented Programming. The phpAspect compiler 
    weaves aspects implementing crosscutting concerns 
    (see the weaving chain) into PHP source code. 
    The weaving process is static (before source code execution) 
    and based on Lex and Yacc analysis. The woven PHP source 
    code can be executed with any PHP 5 version.

    In software engineering, the programming paradigm of 
    Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), also called 
    Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD), attempts to aid 
    programmers in the separation of concerns, or the breaking down 
    of a program into distinct parts that overlap in functionality as 
    little as possible. In particular, AOP focuses on the modularization 
    and encapsulation of cross-cutting concerns.

    phpAspect contains all the "traditionnals" joinpoints of AOP. 
    However, The aim of this project is to offer an AOP which fit with 
    all the web-specifics concerns that php developers are facing.
